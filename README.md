# Zen Garden Visualization in OpenGL

3D visualization project created for CS-330 Computer Graphics using OpenGL. Features an interactive miniature Zen garden scene with textured objects, dynamic lighting, and smooth camera controls.

## Features
- Textured container with detailed rim using cylinder and torus primitives
- Wooden bridge combining curved arch with support posts
- Decorative ornaments using composite shapes
- Interactive camera with WASD movement and mouse controls
- Toggle between perspective and orthographic views

## Installation
1. Clone repository
2. Open solution in Visual Studio
3. Build and run project
4. Use WASD/QE for movement, mouse for camera rotation

## Controls
- WASD - Move camera forward/left/back/right
- QE - Move camera up/down  
- Mouse - Look around
- Mouse wheel - Adjust movement speed
- P/O - Switch perspective/orthographic views

## Dependencies
- OpenGL
- GLEW
- GLM
- GLFW

## Key Learnings
- 3D graphics pipeline implementation
- Texture and material management
- Camera system development
- Modular graphics programming
- Transformation matrices 
- Lighting and shading techniques

I was thought core computer graphics concepts while creating an aesthetically pleasing interactive scene.
